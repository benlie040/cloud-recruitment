# cloud-recruitment

This PHP project is part of the recruitment process at a company I'm applying to.
The task is to create different PHP scripts, for analyzing an nginx access logfile to gather
a few statistics and determine issues related to the UTM licences of the client servers.

## Roadmap

- **`Task #1`**: Identify the ten serial numbers, which are accessing the server the most and their amount of requests.
- **`Task #2`**: Identify the ten serial numbers, which are installed on more than one device and violate this rule the most.
- **`Task #3`** (optional): Identify the different classes of hardware and provide the number of licenses active on these classes.
